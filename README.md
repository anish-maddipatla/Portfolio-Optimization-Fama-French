# Portfolio Optimization and Multifactor Return Analysis

### Description
[cite_start]This project uses Python to construct and optimize global equity portfolios based on Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory[cite: 47]. [cite_start]It then analyzes the portfolio's excess returns using the Fama-French 3-factor model to identify the key drivers of performance beyond the general market[cite: 48].

### Technologies & Models Used
* [cite_start]**Languages/Libraries:** Python (pandas, numPy, matplotlib) [cite: 52]
* **Financial Models:**
    * [cite_start]Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz) [cite: 47]
    * [cite_start]Fama-French 3-Factor Model [cite: 48]
    * [cite_start]Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) [cite: 50]

### Key Outcomes & Analysis
* [cite_start]Constructed portfolios targeting both minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio under short-selling and no-short-selling constraints[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]Performed multifactor regression using the Fama-French model, analyzing the impact of market, size (SMB), and value (HML) factors[cite: 48].
* [cite_start]Demonstrated a **23% increase in explanatory power** over the standard CAPM, validated by a higher R-squared value and statistically significant factor loadings[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]Benchmarked portfolio performance against the NIFTY 50, deriving allocation strategies from risk-adjusted returns and factor exposure insights[cite: 50].
